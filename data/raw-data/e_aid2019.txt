However given the current lack of transport infrastructure and electricity they cannot be preserved and will perish. The overall purpose of this project is to develop and implement a low cost, and robust solar fruit preservation technology that can enhance local food and economic security without depending on the co-development of infrastructure. In the first part of this project, prototype pouches of breathable material have been developed and demonstrated how to concentrate fruit juice using only solar energy. The pouches allows water to evaporate, but protects the juice from contamination by microorganisms and insects. During evaporation the sugar concentration will increase and as most fruits have low pH it becomes storage stable (i.e. halts microbial growth) and can be stored in the household for the lean season, or sold to earn cash. Finally, specific strains of Lactobacillus can be used to improve the taste, and other strains can improve digestion or destruct undesirable substances as phytates, tannins, and polyphenols.  Methods: -Optimize design with respect to drying rate, heat and mass trans ...

The state-owned power utility and the government agencies who are supposed to regulate the sector have a limited capacity to overcome the problems.In 2003, the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar asked Sweden for assistance in addressing the problems experienced in the energy sector. A three-step program that covered policy, organizational capacity and technical improvements was designed and a first phase was implemented between 2007 and 2010. The outcomes of this first phase were positive . Among other things, technical losses were reduced from 33 % in 2008 to 24% in 2014 , and the non- technical losses decreased by 40% and the power utility ZECO's revenue grew from 2.8 billion TSH per month to over 5 billion TSH per month during the same period.

The state-owned power utility and the government agencies who are supposed to regulate the sector have a limited capacity to overcome the problems.In 2003, the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar asked Sweden for assistance in addressing the problems experienced in the energy sector. A three-step program that covered policy, organizational capacity and technical improvements was designed and a first phase was implemented between 2007 and 2010. The outcomes of this first phase were positive . Among other things, technical losses were reduced from 33 % in 2008 to 24% in 2014 , and the non- technical losses decreased by 40% and the power utility ZECO's revenue grew from 2.8 billion TSH per month to over 5 billion TSH per month during the same period. In addition, a number of reforms in the sector were implemented and the organizational capacity has been strengthened with the result that be ...

The following are the intended outcome of the intervention,1. Increased income levels for farmers through increased milk production from biogas milk storage facilities, improved yields from the use of bio slurry and improved livestock farming through use of biogas powered incubators.2. Improved cooking environment by substituting characoal/firewood with biogas. The charcoal/firewood produces harmful gases which mostly affects the health of women and children.3. Sustainable use of natural resources through substitution of charcoal/firewood ( which contributes todeforestation) with biogas for cooking.The intervention targets to solve the problem of lack of access to modern energy services in the rural areas of Zambia where less than 5% of the population have access to electricity.Due to the vastness of the country and the sparse settlements, it is very expensive to extend the grid to the rural areas. Offgrid solutions such as biogas should therefore be explored as an option for providing access to electricity for rural dwellers. About 60% of Zambia's population, majority of which depend on agriculture,live in rural areas. SNV estimates that 310,000 households keep cattle, 140,000 households keep pigs and that there are about 3,000 dairy farmers, and growing. The chall ...

Target of 95% leads to new challenges. Fossil fuels must also be replaced in sectors where no technological alternatives are available. In aviation and maritime transport or in the chemical industry, fuels cannot easily be replaced. Since biofuels are not available to a sufficient extent, electricity-based fuels produced on the basis of hydrogen, to which carbon is enriched (methanisation or Fischer-Tropsch process) are an option. Large quantities of renewable electricity are needed to recover hydrogen and in chemical processes. The technologies are not yet marketable, but represent currently the most promising option in selected sectors. Although these (expensive) options are considered in the current decarbonisation scenarios only after the year 2030/35, it is necessary to start testing and preparing the technology paths today.|||0|2|0||0||||1||||0|2|0|0|2019-11-18|||||||0.000000|0.000000|0.000000|0.000000|0.000000|||||

The new windows result in more convenient learning conditions for the students and reduce the risk of getting a cold.

As the use of renewable energy - in particular photovoltaics - is now a cost-optimized option in many off-grid settings, solar electricity will be used for many electrification projects. A central precondition for the successful implementation of these political targets is the use of safe, high-quality components and systems for renewable energy that are adapted to international standards. For this to be possible, the national Quality Infrastructure (QI) has to render internationally recognized and demand-oriented services. The national quality infrastructure comprises metrology, standardization and testing, as well as conformity assessment, certification and accreditation. Currently, demand-oriented, recognized services are not provided in the national QI, or are not used effectively - as a result, the potential of photovoltaics is not sufficiently exploited.|||0|1|1||0||||1||||0|2|0|0|2017-01-01|||||||0.000000|0.000000|0.000000|0.000000|0.000000|||||

The TB dispensary Zaporizhzhia, like many other hospitals in Ukraine, uses outdated equipment produced in the days of the Soviet Union. The project makes it possible for the TB dispensary to buy a modern Medical x-ray processor which is going to improve and speed up the diagnostic process, as well as to reduce the consumption of electricity and water (at the moment 500 litres per day), previously required for the development of x-rays.

Also, the lamps will replace oil lamps and thus decrease the risk of fires and lung disease.|||0|0|0||0||||1||||0|1|0|0|2019-09-02|||||||0.000000|0.000000|0.000000|0.000000|0.000000|||||

Decentralized individual systems with high energy consumption and climate-damaging-refrigerants are predominantly used. Sustainable implementation of the government's action plan requires a shift to more energy-efficient central systems that use natural refrigerants with low or no global warming potential. In order to further disseminate these technologies, a strategic roadmap will be developed, business models will be developed and the framework conditions for their successful implementation will be described (Phase 1). When the partners bring the solutions developed into the political process and decide to apply for international funding to implement them, they are supported in the application process (Phase 2).

Most people living in this area strongly depend on agriculture. (Drinking) water has to be collected at far-off tube-wells, work that mostly is done by women and children at the expense of their health and education. Besides, most families in this region are cut off the electricity grid. That is why NFLS considers necessary the purchase of solar panels. Through the project, NFLS aims to make access to clean water and safe energy sources for light generation easier. NFLS is hoping to thus relieve women and children who could then do a different work or go to school instead. Plus, solar-powered light that is also working during night increases security and allows the people to continue working and learning in the evening.|||1|0|0||0||||1||||0|0|1|0|2019-04-02|||||||0.000000|0.000000|0.000000|0.000000|0.000000|||||

There are well-documented labour shortages in these fields in West and Central Africa, which present barriers to the development and application of new technologies and the growth of emerging sectors such as clean energy. Technology and personnel gaps in this sector also have an adverse effect on progress towards several Sustainable Development Goals linked to access to reliable electricity from national grids and micro-grids, both of which are increasingly using solar photovoltaic panels. Senegal has emerged as a leader in solar electricity in West Africa, where there has been significant recent growth. This project will strengthen linkages between universities and the private sector in the solar energy sector in Senegal, where the current supply of skills, technologies, and knowledge does not meet the demand. The project is co-funded by Meridiam, a leading solar energy production company in Senegal. It will address the lack of skilled labour in solar energy within the national electricity provider (Senelec), and it will contribute to training other technicians across the country. Both of these modules will be designed as new certi ...

Approximately 60% of the country's rural population lacks access to electricity and clean cooking. However, this situation is expected to change with the ongoing implementation of the government's National Electrification Plan, which aims to electrify all households by 2030 through grid and off-grid infrastructures. Unfortunately, while off-grid renewable energy systems are scaling up, rigorous impact evaluations of the benefits from off-grid electrification in resource-constrained settings are sparse, and gender-differentiated benefits almost non-existent. This is particularly important when considering that rural communities, women and children in particular, are extremely vulnerable to global and regional climate change-related risks. Without such evaluations, the implementation and sustainability of mini-grid systems in rural communities can be impeded. The project seeks to answer two broad questions: First, does electricity supplied through off/mini-grid renewables benefit households in rural communities? Second, are these benefits equitably distributed across income groups, gender, and ethnicity? The project will conduct a multi-stage diagnosis-design-test framework to measure the impacts of off/mini-grid renewables using an experimental de ...

They are considered vital to reducing energy bills and reducing emissions and air pollution, while also improving energy security and sovereignty, and increasing access to energy. However, there are still significant barriers to the effective implementation of inclusive energy-efficient policies in developing countries. Women in rural areas are particularly affected by poor access to reliable energy sources such as electricity, thus forcing households to turn to biofuels such as wood and dung to cook, light, and warm their homes. This energy poverty remains one of the most formidable challenges to any progress in global development. Although a growing body of literature is emerging on how improved energy efficiency and reduced energy demand generate climate benefits, there is still a lack of empirical evidence on how to deliver the scale and speed required. This project is being implemented by Quebec-based Econoler Inc., which specializes in the development and implementation of energy efficiency and clean energy production. It is aimed at identifying energy efficiency measures and exploring options to improve inclusiveness in access and decision-making in rural areas of West African countries as a combined mitigation (reduction of emissions) an ...

The project was divided into two phases and the first phase (EUR 3.5 million) has supposedly already been implemented. ELTEL applied in January 2004 for a buyer credit guarantee for the remaining amount of EUR 2.5 million but later (2005) the size of the project was raised to about EUR 9.4 million and the concessional credit requirement to about EUR 7.2 million. The present Feasibility Study proposes a concessional credit of about EUR 6.5 million.|||0|0|0|0|0||||||1|1|0|0|0|0|2011-02-02||||||||||||||||

Description: Electric vehicles (EVs) are widely viewed as a promising solution for sustainable transport. However, making EVs a sustainable solution depends on a variety of factors, such as the cleanness of the electricity mix. Here we propose to focus on China and India, two major emerging markets, to understand the conditions under which EVs can provide co-benefits for air quality, health and climate change simultaneously. Both countries are major carbon emitters, highly-polluting regions, and fast-growing EV markets. In enabling the growth of EVs, China and India face critical challenges with curbing coal power plants, building new infrastructure, and shifting consumer preferences. To help develop solutions for these challenges, our goal is to quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of various country-specific factors, including industrial policies (e.g. subsidy and regulations) and institutional factors (e.g. power sector practices such as electricity pricing and dispatch decisions).

Description: Electric vehicles (EVs) are widely viewed as a promising solution for sustainable transport. However, making EVs a sustainable solution depends on a variety of factors, such as the cleanness of the electricity mix. Here we propose to focus on China and India, two major emerging markets, to understand the conditions under which EVs can provide co-benefits for air quality, health and climate change simultaneously. Both countries are major carbon emitters, highly-polluting regions, and fast-growing EV markets. In enabling the growth of EVs, China and India face critical challenges with curbing coal power plants, building new infrastructure, and shifting consumer preferences. To help develop solutions for these challenges, our goal is to quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of various country-specific factors, including industrial policies (e.g. subsidy and regulations) and institutional factors (e.g. power sector practices such as electricity pricing and dispatch decisions). Methodologically, we will design a series of present-day and future scenarios to represent these key factors, and utilize an integrated assessment modeling method that combines emissions analysis, air quality modeling, and health impact assessment. Our findings could inform policy making to unlock the air quality, health and climate co-benefits of EVs in  ...

Description: Indian cities endure the world s worst air pollution. Climate change may exacerbate this problem, but mitigation efforts could deliver substantial co-benefits for air quality and health. Using an interdisciplinary modeling approach, we quantify the air quality-health co-benefits of ambitious mitigation and adaptation policies in Ahmedabad, India through collaboration among the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Gujarat Energy Research &amp, Management Institute, Public Health Foundation of India, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. This work could help to motivate transformative climate actions that deliver near-term benefits. Prior partnerships between NRDC, Ahmedabad, and the Public Health Foundation of India resulted in adoption of adaptation strategies to cope with extreme heat exposures, this work informs recent air pollution risk communication efforts. To estimate co-benefits, we propose three successive aims: Aim 1: Estimate 2030 total electricity demand, considering climate change and air conditioning demand in buildings. Aim 2: Model and compare air quality (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)<sub> </sub>associated with<sub> </sub>two 2030 climate change response strategies: (A) [mitigation] shifting fossil fuel use towards solar energy, and (B) [adaptation] expanding cool roof/green landcover interventions.

Related issues (Comic Relief): HIV/AIDS. Summary: Young people in four large informal settlements on the outskirts of Harare, Zimbabwe face multiple challenges. Schools are often non-existent, especially at secondary level, and all other services are usually absent, including social centres, health facilities, public sanitation, electricity and shops. There is a very high youth population, swollen by rural- urban migration, and HIV infection is on the rise. Residents report very high incidences of rape, prostitution, and drug and alcohol abuse. Restless Development Zimbabwe will tackle this through non-formal education, coupled with youth-friendly activities, like sport, and the use of peer educators, managed by volunteers and staff. MAC AIDS funded 43 percent of this grant but the whole amount is attributed to Comic Relief as no double-counting occurs.

Minority returnees are primarily ethnic Serbs who were forced to leave their homes during the 1992-1995 war. After peace, many returned to their original homes in the ethnically homogenized areas of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where they form a minority from a national perspective, often discriminated by local authorities, employers, etc.Building solar systems will promote energy self-sufficiency and improve the quality of life of forty households that have used fossil (naphtha) or solid (wood) fuels to produce energy and heat. As part of project sustainability, local business personnel will be trained in the installation and maintenance of solar systems. Given that the majority of households' income comes from small-scale agriculture, they will also be linked to the local agricultural cooperative  Eco-rural  Drini?. With solar power, minority returnees will be able to grow and store their products for resale to the cooperative. As part of the awareness campaign, 600 children from local schools in the region will be made aware of the benefits of obtaining renewable energy.|7.2,13||0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0||| ...

V sklopu projekta se bo izvedla delna rekonstrukcija javne razsvetljave in vgradnja novega sistema za nadzor in upravljanje. Žarnice, ki so v uporabi, se bodo zamenjale z LED diodami, ki zadostujejo standardom z vidika energetske u?inkovitosti in svetlobnega onesnaževanja, omogo?ajo pa tudi primerno osvetljevanje cest in ostalih površin. Namen projekta je posodobitev javne razsvetljave, ki bo omogo?ila prihranke elektri?ne energije in zmanjšanje svetlobnega onesnaževanja, s ?emer se bo zmanjšala obremenitev okolja. Pove?ala se bo stopnja osvetljenosti in s tem varnost udeležencev v prometu. / City of Kraljevo records high electricity consumption for providing public lighting, which is obsolete and without proper supervision. Within the project the partial reconstruction of public lighting and installation of a new control and management system will be carried out. The bulbs in use will be replaced by LED bulbs that meet the standards in terms of energy efficiency and light pollution, as well as adequate illumination of roads and other surfaces. The purpose of the project is to modernize public lighting, which will save energy and reduce light pollution, thereby reducing the burden on the environment. The level of illumination will be increased and thus the safety of road users.|9.4,7.3,13.a|||2||||0||||1|1||0|2 ...

The Second Green Power Development Project is building a run-of-the-river hydropower plant in central Bhutan through a partnership with several private companies. Clean power generated by the plant will be sold to India and will help reduce carbon emissions. The clean energy from Bhutan will allow India to eliminate around 460,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year that it would otherwise have generated through fossil fuels. The revenue generated from exporting power to India will be used to finance social services in Bhutan such as health, education and rural development. The planned 118-megawatt plant will be located on the Nikachhu River in a narrow valley in the central Trongsa District. As a run-of-the-river plant, it does not need a large reservoir for water storage, but comprehensive safeguard management plans are provisioned for the project implementation.|||0||||||||||||||||2019-12-31||||||||||||||||

The project is expected to provide electricity to about 35,710 rural households, including the former conflict-affected Northern and Eastern provinces as well as Uva and North Central provinces where the current electrification level is lower than in other parts of the country. Improvement of the medium voltage network will enhance the quality and reliability of electricity supply to more than 493,000 consumers. The project is consistent with the interim country partnership strategy for Sri Lanka of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It builds on previous ADB interventions focused on supporting transmission and distribution investments to expand access to clean and reliable electricity, and renewable energy development.|||1||||||||||||||||2019-12-31||||||||||||||||

Surplus power, particularly due to strong river flows from the spring snow melt, will be exported to the northern grid, thus serving as an important source of revenue for the state. However, the program will benefit all Northern Grid-connected electricity consumers via the export of excess power and by eliminating the need to import power from the Northern Grid, thus assisting the Government in its efforts to increase its overall generating capacity and achieve universal electrification under the 11th Five Year Plan. The second main objective is to provide capacity development assistance in order to develop the state hydropower generating company, Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd., into an efficient, corporatized generation company.

The Second Green Power Development Project is building a run-of-the-river hydropower plant in central Bhutan through a partnership with several private companies. Clean power generated by the plant will be sold to India and will help reduce carbon emissions. The clean energy from Bhutan will allow India to eliminate around 460,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year that it would otherwise have generated through fossil fuels. The revenue generated from exporting power to India will be used to finance social services in Bhutan such as health, education and rural development. The planned 118-megawatt plant will be located on the Nikachhu River in a narrow valley in the central Trongsa District. As a run-of-the-river plant, it does not need a large reservoir for water storage, but comprehensive safeguard management plans are provisioned for the project implementation.|||0||||||||||||||||2019-12-31||||||||||||||||

However, a longer-term challenge is to reduce its high dependence on expensive fossil fuel energy. The energy sector struggles to (a) meet growing demand for electricity at a low cost and acceptable reliability rates, and (b) attain long term sustainability. The share of thermal oil-fired energy in the power generation mix has increased from 6% in 1995 to 59% in 2012 that creates a high energy cost base. Demand growth has been mostly met by expensive oil-fired thermal plants. This is not a viable and sustainable solution to the country s energy security and environment protection in the long term. Diversification of the generation mix primarily to renewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, reduced technical losses and supply and demand side management is the only way to correct this situation. The transmission network needs expansion and modernization, particularly in the former conflict-affected areas in Northern and Eastern provinces. The 33 kilovolt (kV) medium voltage (MV) network needs to expand power supply into rural areas where many households have poor reliability and inadequate quality of electricity supply.

The energy sector struggles to (a) meet growing demand for electricity at a low cost and acceptable reliability rates, and (b) attain long term sustainability. The share of thermal oil-fired energy in the power generation mix has increased from 6% in 1995 to 59% in 2012 that creates a high energy cost base. Demand growth has been mostly met by expensive oil-fired thermal plants. This is not a viable and sustainable solution to the country s energy security and environment protection in the long term. Diversification of the generation mix primarily to renewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, reduced technical losses and supply and demand side management is the only way to correct this situation. The transmission network needs expansion and modernization, particularly in the former conflict-affected areas in Northern and Eastern provinces. The 33 kilovolt (kV) medium voltage (MV) network needs to expand power supply into rural areas where many households have poor reliability and inadequate quality of electricity supply.

Simultaneously, its energy usage between 2010-2015 has increased by 11%. Cost of electricity from the Cambodian national grid is the highest in South East Asia. Electricity accounts for a disproportionate share of manufacturing costs. Other cost drivers are the usage of old, inefficient machinery with high maintenance cost.?GGGI's 2018 audits of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SME) show that factories can achieve double-digit energy cost savings – with payback time often not more than a few months. Interventions to promote energy and resource efficiency and drive down production costs for industrial manufacturing translate into a significant potential for GHG emission reduction sector wide and a potential for creating over 500,000 jobs (GGGI, 2018). The lower production costs would boost the competitiveness of Cambodian manufacturing within the sub-region. GGGI Cambodia estimates it can access around 40 SMEs which under-used energy audits of this kind. GGGI Cambodia aims to use these audits to mobilize ESCO investments proximately 3-5 million USD for an aggregated demand from SMEs. GGGI Cambodia aims to achieve the following deliverables: i.)Investment pipeline, business model and transaction structure of energy efficiency projects for manufacturing SMEs built ii.)Guarantee scheme designed iii.)Private investment of 2-3 million USD committed to energy efficiency projects in manufacturing SMEs t ...

With the Fund aiming to pool both domestic and international financial resources, the government not only hopes to improve electricity access in rural areas of Vanuatu, but also to contribute to achieving CO2 emission reduction NDC objective by using close to 100% renewable energy (RE) electricity generation by 2030. NGEF will also support energy efficiency projects, which will contribute towards achieving Vanuatu's national sustainable energy targets elaborated in the National Energy Road Map (NERM) 2016-2030 and in the NERM Implementation Plan (2019) and NDC Roadmap (2019). This project is implemented in partnership with Department of Energy and Ministry of Climate Change in close collaboration with other Ministries, Departments, civil society and private sector representatives that form the NGEF Management Board.|2.3||1||||||||||||0|||0|2019-12-31||||||||||||||||

Its remoteness, small market size and limited institutional capacity remain key barriers to green growth. Over 2015-2016, in collaboration with the World Bank, GGGI provided technical assistance to the Department of Energy for the revision of the National Energy Road Map (NERM). The revised NERM has identified five strategic areas for policy intervention in the energy sector: accessible energy, affordable energy, secure and reliable energy, sustainable energy and green growth. In addition, a financing gap of at least USD 20 million was identified to achieve national energy access targets. 73% of Vanuatu's population does not have access to electricity. The Project aims to implement the objectives of the NERM to achieve 100% rural electrification, while also supporting the 100% renewable energy target also set out in the NERM. It will do so by helping to mobilize financial resources to help fill the USD 20 million financing gap for Vanuatu. The NGEF was included in the NERM as one of the tools for its implementation. The Program also aims to provide green employment opportunities in rural areas through use of renewable energies.|1.a||1||||||||||||0|||0|2019-12-31||||||||||||||||

Ces enjeux font partie des priorités du Rwanda. Ainsi, l'énergie est une des priorités de la « Vision 2020 », par laquelle le Rwanda cherche à devenir un pays à revenus moyens en 2020. Cette vision se traduit en divers plans stratégiques dont le dernier est l'Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy II (EDPRS II 2012-2017) qui explique que « la croissance économique, parmi d'autres choses, sera poussée par la fourniture ininterrompue d'énergie à des prix qui seront stables et régionalement compétitifs ». L'accès à des sources modernes d'énergie à des prix abordables sera crucial si le pays veut réaliser ses objectifs de développement. Cette volonté se traduit dans le plan stratégique sectoriel 2013-2018 (Annexe 8) où le Rwanda vise un mix énergétique au niveau de la production et une augmentation de l'accès à l'énergie. En regard de l'EDPRS II, le plan stratégique prévoit 1) une augmentation des capacités de production électrique, notamment au travers des énergies renouvelables, 2) une augmentation de l'accès à l'électricité, 3) de garantir et de maintenir des tarifs compétitifs au niveau régional. La Stratégie du Rwanda est donc de garantir la « provision de fournitures énergétiques en ...

Energy poverty is an emergent concept that gained a lot of interest since the publication of the Sustainable Development Goals. Before 2005 few works exist on the matter, energy poverty was first defined as a lack of access to electricity and clean energy for heating and cookingor as an inability to meet basic energy needs. However, in the last 10 years, the term energy poverty was generalized to mean fuel poverty and to point out issues of affordability and efficiency in developed countries. My work consisted of understanding the different definitions of energy poverty and in analyzing the different indicators used to measure it. Also, I analyzed the sustainable Goal number 7 called affordable and clean energy.The researcher stayed at the UC3M between September 2019 and january 2020|4.B||1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1||||0|0|0|0|2019-09-02||||||||||||||||

This will add more than 10 Mega Watts (MW) to the country's power generation capacity of an estimated average peak demand requirement of 300-500 MW. There will be a welfare increase in rural communities in terms of saved fuel costs, improved health and education outcomes, improved communications and access to information and health and safety.

The Program will help improve countries' energy supply while reducing significantly greenhouse gas emissions in the Western Balkans and Southern and Easter Mediterranean region (SEMED). The carbon intensity of Western Balkans and SEMED economies is high and the energy demand is growing steadily in both regions. Most countries of the regions rely on fossil fuels for their electricity. The potential for RE applications is high but remains largely untapped, despite significant decreases in prices and improved energy storage solutions. Auctions emerged lately as the most cost efficient and transparent instrument to support investments in renewable energies. The proposed Program, co-financed with EBRD, aims to assist countries in designing and implementing RE auctions to foster investments in renewable energies.|7.2,16,13||0|2|1||0|0|0|0|1||||0|2|0|0|2019-07-01||||||||||||||||

The project also promotes energy efficiency and the development of renewable energies. Ghana is considered as one of the most stable countries in western Africa, characterized by a strong democratic rule of law and a relatively robust economic growth. To secure the country stability and support further growth, it is imperative for Ghana to address the weaknesses of the power sector, notably by increasing electricity generation capacity and reinforcing and extending the reach of the electricity distribution network. Cases in point are that today only about 62% of households nationwide have access to electricity, and urban growth is triggering a steep increase in electricity demand.|7.b,16,13||0|1|1||0|0|0|0|1||||0|1|0|0|2019-12-31||||||||||||||||

The program will contribute to this aim through coordinating both Investment and Advisory Services in four pilot projects in different renewable energy sectors. The program will finance the needed advisory services, while the investment costs for the project development shall be covered by private investors. The program is focused on Indonesia given the country's high relative share of greenhouse gas emissions in East Asia Pacific, the availability of renewable energy sources, and the Government's stated objective to increase the share of renewable energy in the supply mix through the private sector. IFC will be the implementing agency with the fiduciary responsibility for the execution of the Program. The demand for additional electricity in Indonesia is growing rapidly, in line with the country's economic growth. To meet this demand, the government launched a programme to increase power generation capacity by 35 gigawatt over a period of five years. An estimated 11 gigawatt is to be supported by renewable energy. Even though Indonesia possesses a large potential of renewable energy resources, there has been limited examples of successful pri ...

Despite the recent introduction of feed-in tariffs for renewable energy, no similar project have been implemented so far, also because the chances of receiving commercial financing for such a project in Serbia are currently minimal. Serbia's electricity production is highly dependent on coal, a pollutant energy source. In order to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, the country aims to focus more on the use of renewable energy sources. Biomass is one such source, with a large untapped potential. In addition, many of Serbia's public buildings and homes are equipped with ill functioning and highly energy-inefficient heating systems.|7.2,16,13||0|1|1||0|0|0|0|||1||0|1|0|0|2019-12-31||||||||||||||||

Albania is confronted with important challenges in the energy sector, despite the progress made in recent years. Particularly the security of energy supply remains fragile due to lack of diversification. Electricity demand is exceeding domestic production. The supply gap is closed with pricey, imported fossil-based energy from the surrounding countries. Business development is severely constrained by recurring power outages, high electricity prices and administrative obstacles in power supply. The development of an Albanian gas market based on the implementation of TAP represents a valid option for energy supply diversification.|7.b,16,13.1||0|1|1||0|0|0|0|1||||0|0|1|0|2019-12-31||||||||||||||||

General Environment Protection|61000|Private sector in provider country|Econoler Inc.|61000||||2017-12-01|2020-12-01|Sound energy efficiency policies play a critical role in fighting climate change. They are considered vital to reducing energy bills and reducing emissions and air pollution, while also improving energy security and sovereignty, and increasing access to energy. However, there are still significant barriers to the effective implementation of inclusive energy-efficient policies in developing countries. Women in rural areas are particularly affected by poor access to reliable energy sources such as electricity, thus forcing households to turn to biofuels such as wood and dung to cook, light, and warm their homes. This energy poverty remains one of the most formidable challenges to any progress in global development. Although a growing body of literature is emerging on how improved energy efficiency and reduced energy demand generate climate benefits, there is still a lack of empirical evidence on how to deliver the scale and speed required.   This project is being implemented by Quebec-based Econoler Inc., which specializes in the development and implementation of energy efficiency and clean energy production. It is aimed at identifying energy efficiency measures and exploring options to improve inclusiveness in access and decision-making in rural areas of West African countries as a combined mitigation (reduction of emissio ...

Energy Policy|22000|Donor country-based NGO|Innovations for Poverty Action, a non-profit corporation|22000||||2019-09-01|2022-09-01|Myanmar's population is primarily rural, characterized by agriculture-dominated economies and resource-dependent livelihoods. Approximately 60% of the country's rural population lacks access to electricity and clean cooking. However, this situation is expected to change with the ongoing implementation of the government's National Electrification Plan, which aims to electrify all households by 2030 through grid and off-grid infrastructures. Unfortunately, while off-grid renewable energy systems are scaling up, rigorous impact evaluations of the benefits from off-grid electrification in resource-constrained settings are sparse, and gender-differentiated benefits almost non-existent. This is particularly important when considering that rural communities, women and children in particular, are extremely vulnerable to global and regional climate change-related risks. Without such evaluations, the implementation and sustainability of mini-grid systems in rural communities can be impeded.   The project seeks to answer two broad questions: First, does electricity supplied through off/mini-grid renewables benefit households in rural communities? Second, are these benefits equitably distributed across income groups, gender, and ethnicity? The project will conduct a multi-stage diagnosis-design-test framework to measure the impacts of off/mini-grid renewables using an experimental design with treatment and control populations stratified ...

After years of high-impact research and successful engagement with local and national authorities, the Nairobi County government declared a special planning area for Mukuru in August 2017. The special planning area froze development in Mukuru while a consortium of forty local organizations developed an integrated development plan. In recent months, as part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nairobi Metropolitan Services has started implementing the plan and allocated $12 million for infrastructure development during the current financial year. This project will support the efforts of Akiba Mashinani Trust to document and disseminate lessons learned from an innovative and transformational process to redevelop the Mukuru informal settlement. Through field research, policy engagement meetings, workshops, and dissemination events, the project aims to capture first efforts to implement the special planning area redevelopment plan. In capturing lessons learned and emerging best practices, these knowledge translation efforts seek, on one level, to capture the full history of the special planning area story and  ...

There are well-documented labour shortages in these fields in West and Central Africa, which present barriers to the development and application of new technologies and the growth of emerging sectors such as clean energy. Technology and personnel gaps in this sector also have an adverse effect on progress towards several Sustainable Development Goals linked to access to reliable electricity from national grids and micro-grids, both of which are increasingly using solar photovoltaic panels.   Senegal has emerged as a leader in solar electricity in West Africa, where there has been significant recent growth. This project will strengthen linkages between universities and the private sector in the solar energy sector in Senegal, where the current supply of skills, technologies, and knowledge does not meet the demand.   The project is co-funded by Meridiam, a leading solar energy production company in Senegal. It will address the lack of skilled labour in solar energy within the national electricity provider (Senelec), and it will contribute to training other technicians across the country.

This represents 8 percent of global Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and substantial loss of resources such as water and energy. Food losses and waste result from to many reasons, which include inadequate infrastructure and lack or unreliable energy supply, lack of skills and access to markets. A key contributor to food loss in developing countries and in particular Africa and India is the very limited availability of cold food chains for the preservation and temperature controlled distribution of fresh produce to markets.   The Sol-Tech project aims to make a contribution to addressing the food waste challenge and key Sustainable Development Challenges and Goals, including halving food waste by 2030, providing access to energy for all and alleviation of poverty and malnutrition. This will be achieved by building on previous and current research to develop to commercialisation stage an innovative but affordable solar powered modular fresh food cold storage and first mile distribution system for application in areas with no or limited and unreliable access to the electricity grid.

Currently, about one-half Africa's total population is lacking access to electricity. However, the continent is well endowed with renewable energy resources, it is estimated that about 35% of the world resources for wind energy are located in the continent. There are many challenges which hinder the development of infrastructure for wind energy in Africa. Designing suitable foundations to sustain the loads typically applied by wind turbines represents a particular challenge. Most potential locations for wind turbines in Africa are in tropical zones where fluctuation in ground water level is severe. The cycling of water levels means that many deposits of interest are unsaturated for at least part of the year. Unsaturated soils exhibit complex mechanical behaviour, coupled to changes in water content. This research aims to provide design for the foundations of wind turbines in unsaturated soils.|||0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1||||0|0|0|0|||||||||||||||||

Other Multisector|11000|Donor Government|Donor Government|11000||||2019-01-01|2019-12-31|Rising temperatures in cities make access to cool infrastructures a global challenge. The UN's 'Cooling for All' coalition estimates that 1.1 billion people worldwide have little or no access to cooling to protect them against extreme heat .  Those defined as most at risk include 630 million people across South Asia, South East Asia and Sub Saharan Africa who live in poor quality housing on low incomes, with limited, intermittent or insecure access to electricity and few if any electrical cooling appliances. Current global and national frameworks for action on heat in global cities categorise the negative effects of heat on these urban residents as either a public health issue (i.e. leading to heat illness, dehydration and disease) or an economic issue (i.e. leading to a decline in employment, worker productivity and output). Yet this categorisation significantly limits the way that frameworks for action on heat account for socio-economic inequality and gender.  In some countries, like India and Pakistan, international and national frameworks for responding to extreme heat in cities have led to urban heat action plans and public awareness raising. However, action on overheating by city planners and policy makers remains typically top-down and technology driven, frequently challenged by silo-ed agendas, unexamined assumptions about energy cul ...

Latterly, policies and regulations to facilitate energy transition toward low-carbon generation of energy have on the whole been designed for industrial countries, and then transferred to major developing countries with some success in major emerging countries (for instance in South Africa). These approaches have so far achieved little impact in Least Developed and low-income countries. This is mainly due to the relative weakness of their institutions and of attendant regulatory architectures, and a lack of adequate governance structures to implement them. In the case of many African countries, moreover, planning for energy transitions is made more complicated by the competing priority of increasing access to modern energy services, as well as by the political economy competition between centralised, clientelist states and varying degrees of initiatives towards decentralization and devolution of powers towards local governance structures.   RETs production and deployment have risen substantially globally, on the back of huge industrialisation and subsequent cost reductions in the order of 80%.

In START the research direction will be set by considering the local environment and through engagement with scientists, energy industry representatives and relevant non-governmental organisations (NGO's) across Africa.  Most importantly, START is not only about developing new energy materials or structural biology research, equally important is training the next generation of researchers and research leaders in these important areas of study. We will work together in sample fabrication and advanced characterisation through training visits between African and UK institutes. This will include experimental time at Diamond Light Source (the UK national synchrotron source) through peer reviewed access to many of the experimental facilities and in techniques that are the mainstay of understanding these materials. A major ambition of this partnership is to strengthen and broaden the network of synchrotron researchers in Africa, where there is a burgeoning a ...

At present the World Bank estimates there to be about 1.3 billion people without access to electricity. This goal is seen as an enabler to improving the plight of people as determined by the Millennium Development Indices. There is a clear  correlation between per capita electrical energy consumption, energy access and the Human Development Index.  ODA list countries are the front and centre target of this research. This proposal meets the challenge to provide good Tier 3 electricity provision for homes and Tier 4 levels of electricity for community productive services and will be commercially viable at a cost of $4 per month per household (typical low end spend for kerosene). Furthermore, it has been designed so as to be grid ready.   This ambitious challenge is met by delivering a downwards step-change in the costs of distribution infrastructure by recognising that PV is becoming much cheaper and that widespread decentralised storage enables a significant decrease in distribution cabling costs.

At present the World Bank estimates there to be about 1.3 billion people without access to electricity. This goal is seen as an enabler to improving the plight of people as determined by the Millennium Development Indices. There is a clear  correlation between per capita electrical energy consumption, energy access and the Human Development Index.  ODA list countries are the front and centre target of this research. This proposal meets the challenge to provide good Tier 3 electricity provision for homes and Tier 4 levels of electricity for community productive services and will be commercially viable at a cost of $4 per month per household (typical low end spend for kerosene). Furthermore, it has been designed so as to be grid ready.   This ambitious challenge is met by delivering a downwards step-change in the costs of distribution infrastructure by recognising that PV is becoming much cheaper and that widespread decentralised storage enables a significant decrease in distribution cabling costs.

India, the main focus of the project, faces a unique challenge in energising both urban and rural communities. Current options for low cost power almost exclusively involve burning substances to release power. This is unsustainable since India will require 1000GW installed new electricity capacity alone by 2030 if it is to meet its growth projections. In rural Indian communities, pollution is also produced from burning crops and animal waste which, combined with urban fossil fuel use, produces choking smog in its big cities. Our project aims to deliver locally manufactured solutions for low-cost solar electricity generation to deliver environmental and energy benefits. By providing affordable solutions to solar generation, which can be combined with storage, simple solutions of night-time lighting and power can be delivered.

According to the report, eight of the twenty countries with the largest deficits in access to electricity are in East Africa, including Ethiopia, Malawi, and Mozambique. In countries facing such significant gaps in energy access, the rapid adoption of renewable energy may help to deliver access to energy sustainably. The growing availability of renewable technologies in East Africa's countries suggests that such a transition is possible. However, technology alone will not solve the challenge of energy access.   A transition to sustainable energy needs to prioritise the social needs of excluded and disadvantaged groups. Responding to people's energy needs requires institutional, organisational, and financial models of energy delivery that prioritise social benefits over profits.

The way they are tackled impacts on the sustainable infrastructure of our planet. One of the most significant global development challenges is how we mitigate against the proliferation of energy intensive air-conditioning (AC) for cooling and ventilation in buildings in response to a globally warming world and the greater expectations for thermal comfort in buildings that accompany growing affluence. This is particularly pertinent in developing countries such as India as disposable income increases, making AC more easily accessible. Many of India's most populous metropolitan areas such as Mumbai, Chennai and Calcutta have hot and humid climates, and are seeing growth rates in the use of AC of approximately 30% per year. The electricity demand for space cooling comprises up to 60% of the summer peak load in large cities such as New Delhi, and most air-conditioners are inefficient and use refrigerants with high GWP (global warming potential). A solution to this problem is needed urgently. This makes energy efficiency and thermal comfort a priority area for the Indian government in recent revisions of its National Building and Energy Conservation Building Codes which emphasise the need to design buildings for natural v ...

In fact, around a third of Mexican households are unable to access an adequate level of energy services. Similarly, annual energy supply interruptions in Colombia add up to 38 hours per year. However, energy services are essential to wellbeing. Indeed, access to adequate, reliable, affordable and clean energy services underpins a range of human capabilities and when unmet, results in a situation of energy vulnerability (EV). A shortfall in realised energy services can be caused by various socio-technical, institutional and environmental factors, including: unreliable or poor quality infrastructure, gendered differences in energy access and use, high energy prices, social isolation, and stressors caused by intensifying climatic changes. The impacts of this are wide ranging, from adverse health, wellbeing, and social participation outcomes, to limited economic development.   There are no official EV-related strategies in the three countries, and each one is at a different stage in addressing the issue. I ...

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the most energy-deprived region in the world, arguably constitutes the greatest obstacle for realising these goals. An estimated 700 million people in SSA - the majority of them in rural areas -lack electricity access, a number that is only expected to rise as the continent's rural population growth outpaces capacity growth. The three SDG dimensions of achieving energy access - affordability, reliability and sustainability - each stand in stark contrast to the status quo: while the cost of electricity in SSA can be orders of magnitude higher than in industrialised countries, blackouts are frequent, and less than a quarter of energy supply comes from renewable sources. Energy poverty has impaired SSA's economic development since its independence in the 1960s, indicating that new approaches are urgently required.   Given the extent of rural energy poverty, limited rural purchasing power and logistical difficulties, innovative, locally driven business models for the renewable energy sector are required to achieve comprehensive rural electrificati ...

They are left with a gap that can lead to a loss of income and poverty. It can cause a lot of family pressures, especially for girls are left to care for younger children and are not able to go to school. Many of these families come from communities that are already poor, with very little infrastructure and limited access to decent healthcare. This can cause a much higher risk of death, both for mothers and babies, especially in poor countries. Opportunities are more limited because families lack money and education.  Myanmar is a South East Asian country that has had many years of tension and conflict between the different people groups. Many of these groups live in remote mountainous areas where basic resources and infrastructure such as electricity are limited. There is often little healthcare in these areas with very few doctors, nurses or midwives to care for mothers and their families.  One in 23 women in Eastern Myanmar either die or come close to death during pregnancy or childbirth. These challenges are all very typical in developing countries across the world today, but a lot can be changed with education that makes sense to mothers and families in their situations.

This is expected to directly benefit around 360,000 people in rural Sierra Leone, and indirectly help up to 1.8 million people access low carbon electricity. This will add more than 10 Mega Watts (MW) to the country's power generation capacity of an estimated average peak demand requirement of 300-500 MW. There will be a welfare increase in rural communities in terms of saved fuel costs, improved health and education outcomes, improved communications and access to information and health and safety. The project will also result in a significant reduction in Sierra Leone's future Green House Gas emissions through supported private investment in the installation and operation of renewably-powered mini-grids'.|||0|2|0|0|0||0|0||1|||0|2|0|0|||||||||||||||||

Proving secure and affordable energy infrastructure is crucial to promoting inclusive development of rural communities in this region, and solar power is a sustainable way of achieving this. However, ground mounted arrays of solar panels also remove land from food production at a time when crop yields are threatened by a changing climate and increasing populations, insecure ownership and land 'grabbing' are putting pressure on land resources. In practice, economic growth linked to conventional solar arrays may be outweighed by reduced income from crop production and greater food insecurity. Renewable energy technologies which resolve energy, climate and land security conflicts are urgently needed. So called agrivoltiac (AV) systems permit the delivery of solar electricity, crop production, and rainwater harvesting on the same land area. Instead of being ground mounted, arrays are several meters high, enabling crops to be grown underneath. In locations with high light intensity, high temperature, and low rainfall, such as many places in East Africa, the productivity of crops grown beneath these e ...

The project also promotes energy efficiency and the development of renewable energies. Ghana is considered as one of the most stable countries in western Africa, characterized by a strong democratic rule of law and a relatively robust economic growth. To secure the country stability and support further growth, it is imperative for Ghana to address the weaknesses of the power sector, notably by increasing electricity generation capacity and reinforcing and extending the reach of the electricity distribution network. Cases in point are that today only about 62% of households nationwide have access to electricity, and urban growth is triggering a steep increase in electricity demand.|7.b,16,13||0|1|2|||0|||||||0|1|0|0|2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

Ces enjeux font partie des priorités du Rwanda. Ainsi, l'énergie est une des priorités de la « Vision 2020 », par laquelle le Rwanda cherche à devenir un pays à revenus moyens en 2020. Cette vision se traduit en divers plans stratégiques dont le dernier est l'Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy II (EDPRS II 2012-2017) qui explique que « la croissance économique, parmi d'autres choses, sera poussée par la fourniture ininterrompue d'énergie à des prix qui seront stables et régionalement compétitifs ». L'accès à des sources modernes d'énergie à des prix abordables sera crucial si le pays veut réaliser ses objectifs de développement. Cette volonté se traduit dans le plan stratégique sectoriel 2013-2018 (Annexe 8) où le Rwanda vise un mix énergétique au niveau de la production et une augmentation de l'accès à l'énergie. En regard de l'EDPRS II, le plan stratégique prévoit 1) une augmentation des capacités de production électrique, notamment au travers des énergies renouvelables, 2) une augmentation de l'accès à l'électricité, 3) de garantir et de maintenir des tarifs compétitifs au niveau régional. La Stratégie du Rwanda est donc de garantir la « provision de fournitures énergétiques en suffisance, ...

The identification of the key-variables and driving forces that have determined the success of CEFA's energy programme in Tanzania is pursued accordingly with the following steps: (i) historical data collection on the field about n° of connection to the mini-grid and electricity consumption. (ii) analysis of the socioeconomic context by means of interviews and focus group discussion aimed at identify the main dynamics that underly the energy-development nexus in the rural local context with specific attention to the role of complementary action. (iii) application of an ad hoc calibrated System Dynamics model able to reproduce the behaviour of socioeconomic variables along the development pattern driven by the electrification program. (iv) Policy testing and sensitivity analysis to identify the most effective and impactful complementary activities put in place by CEFA and other partners together with the provision of electricity.|7||0|1|2||0|0|2|0|1|||||2|2||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

As the use of renewable energy - in particular photovoltaics - is now a cost-optimized option in many off-grid settings, solar electricity will be used for many electrification projects. A central precondition for the successful implementation of these political targets is the use of safe, high-quality components and systems for renewable energy that are adapted to international standards. For this to be possible, the national Quality Infrastructure (QI) has to render internationally recognized and demand-oriented services. The national quality infrastructure comprises metrology, standardization and testing, as well as conformity assessment, certification and accreditation.Currently, demand-oriented, recognized services are not provided in the national QI, or are not used effectively - as a result, the potential of photovoltaics is not sufficiently exploited.|||0|1|1||0||||1||||0|2|0|0|2017-01-01||||||||||||||||

The national electricity market will be opened up to competition and renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) will be promoted. To achieve this, the Grenadian government will be supported in revising and amending legal principles, starting a dialog process with the main electricity supplier, developing a road map for greater use of RE and EE, and establishing an exchange platform for investors in RE and EE areas. This approach can potentially point the way forward for other regions. Alongside the reduction of direct greenhouse-gas emissions, this project will reduce dependency on oil imports and consequently the burden on the government budget, the population and the private sector. EE measures and  green marketing  will help strengthen the tourism, agriculture and light industry sectors, and create jobs.|||0|0|0||0||||1||||0|2|0|0|2015-02-26||||||||||||||||

The project combines climate and energy policies, particularly in urban development. It supports key climate and energy policy stakeholders (mainly distribution network operators) in the transition to a low-emission energy sector with the aim of achieving the national climate targets and NDC s. The project also develops framework conditions for a decentralised PV energy supply, demonstrating its feasibility by means of a prototype.

Part of the German Climate Technology Initiative, the project supports the government in the effective implementation of the Solar Plan and thus in the expansion of renewable energies on a large scale. This is done at several levels in the technical components of the project, through policy advice, for example, that is aimed at developing effective regulations. The implementation of the Solar Plan is accompanied by continuous macro-economic analyses, the results of which are incorporated into the energy and low emission strategies which are continuously adapted – and the advice provided on how to establish a regulator in the electricity sector will result in more intensive competition.Through further training and accompanying support, the project also strengthens the competences of specialists and managers from participating institutions and Tunisian private companies.|||0|1|0||0||||1||||0|2|0|0|2015-08-26||||||||||||||||

The impact of the mobility options will be considered, improved and analysed in a holistic way - from the production and design of the vehicles, to the energy supply and the recycling of the vehicles and the energy supply infrastructure. In the framework of a pilot implementation in Ghana at the site of the local partner Don Bosco, a sharing system for e-mopeds and cargo bikes will be tested technically and economically and adapted in consideration of local conditions and user requirements. Sustainable mobility needs to be planned in connection with renewable energy supply. Therefore, a smart mini-grid of solar systems and charging stations will be developed within the project. This mini-grid, unlike stand-alone systems, has sufficient power to supply the e-vehicles.Part of the mini-grid is an automated metering of the vehicles' electricity consumption and smart demand management through real-time adjustment of the electricity price to supply, demand, weather and battery status. The aim is to intensify the use of sustainable mobility alternatives and at the same time to contribute to the improved access to reliable and sustainable energy.

Through the implementation of the waste-to-energy plant and the new landfill, the existing landfill can be closed. This prevents the discharge of untreated sewage into the river. Thus, other  energy sources such as oil or coal power plants can be substituted, which has a positive effect on the C02 balance. In addition, the particularly climate-damaging landfill gas (mainly methane) is collected and also fed to thermal utilization.  Furthermore, this city benefits from the implementation of a modern waste management system that focuses more on recycling in order to reduce the amount of waste generated. The purpose of this project is to reduce environmental damage from  the existing landfill, as well as improving the environmental impact of the garbage of the city. The project will rehabilitate the existing landfill site and build a state-of-the-art waste incinerator that will meet all required standards.

The development objective of the intervention is poverty alleviation in rural mainland Tanzania through the providing of access to modern energy services based on renewable resources. Lack of access to electricity has been shown and is widely accepted as one of the main constraints to growth.REA was established in 2007 under the Rural Energy Act to promote and facilitate access to modern energy services in rural areas of mainland Tanzania by providing grants, subsidies and capacity building to developers of rural energy projects. The ambition in Tanzania is to increase energy access in the rural areas from 21% in 2014 to 50% per cent by 2020. In this regard REF is key to reach those results.The overall objective of the proposed programme is to contribute to the Tanzanian Government's aim to reach the UN initiative Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) ambition of universal energy access by 2030.

However given the current lack of transport infrastructure and electricity they cannot be preserved and will perish. The overall purpose of this project is to develop and implement a low cost, and robust solar fruit preservation technology that can enhance local food and economic security without depending on the co-development of infrastructure. In the first part of this project, prototype pouches of breathable material have been developed and demonstrated how to concentrate fruit juice using only solar energy. The pouches allows water to evaporate, but protects the juice from contamination by microorganisms and insects. During evaporation the sugar concentration will increase and as most fruits have low pH it becomes storage stable (i.e. halts microbial growth) and can be stored in the household for the lean season, or sold to earn cash. Finally, specific strains of Lactobacillus can be used to improve the taste, and other strains can improve digestion or destruct undesirable substances as phytates, tannins, and polyphenols.  Methods: -Optimize design with respect to drying rate, hea ...

With average hurricane force winds over 170 km/h and gusts up to 240 km/h, the cyclone caused widespread destruction across the Central, Eastern, and Western divisions in Fiji.  Many small and remote islands lay in the direct path of TC Harold. It is estimated that more than 182,500 people in Fiji (or around 20% of the population) were directly affected. Destructive winds, storm surges and flooding from TC Harold destroyed villages, homes and government buildings, and severely damaged agriculture and infrastructure, including for water supply, waste and sanitation, electricity, and communications. An estimated 90% of crops have been destroyed in the most affected areas, leaving families with no alternative food source. Outbreaks of typhoid, leptospirosis, and dengue fever have been identified by the Ministry of Health as a major concern.A state of natural disaster was declared for the affected divisions in Fiji on 12 April 2020. The NDMO is coordinating and monitoring relief efforts which are being undertaken by government agencies and local and international nongovernmental organizations. This  has been particularly challenging given the remoteness of affected islands, travel restrictions due to COVID-19 outbreak, disruption to communication channels, limited number of boat vessels undertaking assessments, and stretched human resources.|||0||||||||||||||||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

Energy distribution|12000|Recipient Government|Bihar State Electricity Board_(BSEB)|12000||||||Electric power is an essential item for economic development and improvement of social wellbeing of India. It faces formidable challenges in achieving balanced infrastructure development, where the provision of adequate energy plays an essential role in reducing poverty through sustainable economic growth. The Government of India (GOI) has confirmed its `Power for All' initiative to provide universal power supply by 2012, which will require 100,000 megawatt (MW) of new generation capacity and related transmission and distribution facilities. Cognizant of the vast impact on the global environment and energy security, the GOI developed the Integrated Energy Policy, 2006. The policy encapsulates the vision to meet the demand for energy services of all sectors reliably with safe, clean, and convenient energy in a technically efficient, economically viable, and environmentally sustainable manner. The past poor performance of state electricity boards was a roadblock to private sector investment in the power sector. In 2001, the GOI adopted a program of unbundling, open access, tariff restructuring, and rationalization.

The Second Green Power Development Project is building a run-of-the-river hydropower plant in central Bhutan through a partnership with several private companies. Clean power generated by the plant will be sold to India and will help reduce carbon emissions. The clean energy from Bhutan will allow India to eliminate around 460,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year that it would otherwise have generated through fossil fuels. The revenue generated from exporting power to India will be used to finance social services in Bhutan such as health, education and rural development. The planned 118-megawatt plant will be located on the Nikachhu River in a narrow valley in the central Trongsa District. As a run-of-the-river plant, it does not need a large reservoir for water storage, but comprehensive safeguard management plans are provisioned for the project implementation.|||1||||||||||||||||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

ADB has supported Tajikistan power sector reforms through the ongoing Sector Operation Performance Improvements (SOPI) program, which has built the basis for the fundamental reform program of PSDP that includes unbundling of the vertically integrated power utility company, restructuring of the utility's excessive liabilities, establishment of a regulator, adoption of a tariff methodology, and establishment of a new centralized cash control system among unbundled entities. As a part of reforms and institutional capacity building, a newly established power distribution company will be given a 5-year management contract. Investments in the retail advanced metering system in Dushanbe and 6 other cities will also fill the key deficiencies in the sector's power loss accounting and bill collection systems. The program is included in the Country Operations Business Plan, 2019-2021.

The Second Green Power Development Project is building a run-of-the-river hydropower plant in central Bhutan through a partnership with several private companies. Clean power generated by the plant will be sold to India and will help reduce carbon emissions. The clean energy from Bhutan will allow India to eliminate around 460,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year that it would otherwise have generated through fossil fuels. The revenue generated from exporting power to India will be used to finance social services in Bhutan such as health, education and rural development. The planned 118-megawatt plant will be located on the Nikachhu River in a narrow valley in the central Trongsa District. As a run-of-the-river plant, it does not need a large reservoir for water storage, but comprehensive safeguard management plans are provisioned for the project implementation.|||1||||||||||||||||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

The clean energy from Bhutan will allow India to eliminate around 460,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year that it would otherwise have generated through fossil fuels. The revenue generated from exporting power to India will be used to finance social services in Bhutan such as health, education and rural development. The planned 118-megawatt plant will be located on the Nikachhu River in a narrow valley in the central Trongsa District.

Energy Policy|12000|Recipient Government|Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA)|12000||||||Electricity is a necessary requirement for accelerating the economic development of any country and is considered an important input to improve quality of life. Overall, the electricity demand has far outgrown the supply, leading to load curtailment and increased dependence on imports from India in recent times. The peak suppressed demand in Nepal in FY2013?2014 has been around 1,200 megawatt (MW) as against installed capacity of 787 MW, hence resulting in a deficit of about 440 MW due to non-availability of generation. Government has plans to generate additional 10,000 MW in the next 10 years. About 63% of the population in Nepal has access to electricity but the supply quality is unreliable and inadequate. The government has recognized the immediate need for reinforcement and upgrade of outdated distribution systems crucial to deliver the required energy to the customers even if the generation and transmission lines are in place. In this regard, the need for immediate distribution network enhancement is included in the government?s action plan to address energy crisis and provide universal access to reliable and efficient electricity for all by 2030. This will contribute in promoting sustainable energy for all (Sustainable Development Goal #7) and Nepal?s Intended Nationally Determined Commitments for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.<br><br>ADB?s Nepal country partnership strategy 2013?2017 supports the government's development objective of ac ...

There are 66 national poverty counties and 131 provincial poverty counties in the four participating provinces, with a poor population of about 9 million. About 43% of the project s subprojects are located in these poor counties. The project consists of four components: (i) sustainable development and demonstration of commercial practices of medium- and large-scale biogas plants (MLBGPs), (ii) effective utilization of biogas sludge in eco-farming, (iii) capacity development for improved sector performance, and (iv) project implementation support. The project will assist about 118 medium-sized and large livestock farms and agro-enterprises in constructing biogas plants, and introduce a new technical specification to the plant design. The new specification involves the installation of high-temperature flares in the MLBGPs to minimize the methane gas emissions during maintenance and emergency this has been a common standard in developed countries but not yet in the PRC. The project will also demonstrate business models of centralized biogas plant systems to improve their cost-effectiveness, and technical and environmental performances, and assist 25 subprojects to overcome barriers to c ...

EESL was set up as a government-owned energy services company (ESCO) to facilitate energy efficiency investments, including work designing, implementing, monitoring and investing in energy efficiency projects. ADB?s loan will cover high-priority areas under EESL?s ESCO business namely through use of: (i) more efficient light-emitting diode (LED) municipal street lighting equipped with remote operating technology, (ii) more efficient domestic lighting and fans through replacement of incandescent lights with LEDs and more efficient fans, and (iii) more energy efficient agricultural water pumps. EESL estimates that energy savings of 80% can be achieved in the domestic lighting programs and 30% can be achieved with more efficient pumps. Savings will result in lower electricity bills for consumers, peak power shaving, and reduced commercial losses for distribution companies. The project will also demonstrate the potential for energy efficiency achievements and scalability of the ESCO model for realizing energy savings in India.|||||||||||||||1||||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

The results obtained will serve as input for the preparation of the following documents: i) Challenges for the development of the Country (CDC, for its acronym in English) and ii) Agenda for the Growth of the Andean Region. In the last decade, Bolivia has made important progress in reducing poverty. For example, moderate poverty went from 60% to 36% between 2006 and 2017 and extreme poverty from 38% to 17%. However, these advances also generate another kind of pressure from a new middle class that tends to migrate from the countryside to the city, concentrating on peri-urban areas and often facing problems related to the lack of quality public services (water, electricity, health, housing, security, etc.), as well as the difficulty to find sources of work in conditions of formality. The rapid growth of the middle class poses challenges such as: the generation of modern, versatile and quality information on poverty, the study of the characteristics of this new population, its main needs and vulnerabilities, as well as a diagnosis of the capacity that can be have the main public institutions to meet the demands of this sector of citizenship.|||||||||||||||||||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

Energy poverty is an emergent concept that gained a lot of interest since the publication of the Sustainable Development Goals. Before 2005 few works exist on the matter, energy poverty was first defined as a lack of access to electricity and clean energy for heating and cookingor as an inability to meet basic energy needs. However, in the last 10 years, the term energy poverty was generalized to mean fuel poverty and to point out issues of affordability and efficiency in developed countries. My work consisted of understanding the different definitions of energy poverty and in analyzing the different indicators used to measure it. Also, I analyzed the sustainable Goal number 7 called affordable and clean energy.The researcher stayed at the UC3M between September 2019 and january 2020|4.B||1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1||||0|0|0|0|2019-09-02||||||||||||||||

They are considered vital to reducing energy bills and reducing emissions and air pollution, while also improving energy security and sovereignty, and increasing access to energy. However, there are still significant barriers to the effective implementation of inclusive energy-efficient policies in developing countries. Women in rural areas are particularly affected by poor access to reliable energy sources such as electricity, thus forcing households to turn to biofuels such as wood and dung to cook, light, and warm their homes. This energy poverty remains one of the most formidable challenges to any progress in global development. Although a growing body of literature is emerging on how improved energy efficiency and reduced energy demand generate climate benefits, there is still a lack of empirical evidence on how to deliver the scale and speed required.   This project is being implemented by Quebec-based Econoler Inc., which specializes in the development and implementation of energy efficiency and clean energy production. It is aimed at identifying energy efficiency measures and exploring options to improve inclusiveness in access and decision-making in rural areas of West African countries as a ...

There are well-documented labour shortages in these fields in West and Central Africa, which present barriers to the development and application of new technologies and the growth of emerging sectors such as clean energy. Technology and personnel gaps in this sector also have an adverse effect on progress towards several Sustainable Development Goals linked to access to reliable electricity from national grids and micro-grids, both of which are increasingly using solar photovoltaic panels. Senegal has emerged as a leader in solar electricity in West Africa, where there has been significant recent growth. This project will strengthen linkages between universities and the private sector in the solar energy sector in Senegal, where the current supply of skills, technologies, and knowledge does not meet the demand. The project is co-funded by Meridiam, a leading solar energy production company in Senegal. It will address the lack of skilled labour in solar energy within the national electricity provider (Senelec), and it will contribute to training other technicians across the country. Both of these modules will be designed as new certificate courses, developed in conju ...

There are well-documented labour shortages in these fields in West and Central Africa, which present barriers to the development and application of new technologies and the growth of emerging sectors such as clean energy. Technology and personnel gaps in this sector also have an adverse effect on progress towards several Sustainable Development Goals linked to access to reliable electricity from national grids and micro-grids, both of which are increasingly using solar photovoltaic panels. Senegal has emerged as a leader in solar electricity in West Africa, where there has been significant recent growth. This project will strengthen linkages between universities and the private sector in the solar energy sector in Senegal, where the current supply of skills, technologies, and knowledge does not meet the demand. The project is co-funded by Meridiam, a leading solar energy production company in Senegal. It will address the lack of skilled labour in solar energy within the national electricity provider (Senelec), and it will contribute to training other technicians across the country. Both of these modules will be designed as new certificate courses, developed in conjunc ...

Just over a quarter (28 per cent) of the 12.4m population have access to electricity and chronic power cuts have previously led to civil unrest. The country has vast and underdeveloped hydropower resources but currently only 400MW of installed grid capacity, dropping to as low as 150MW of reliable power.Eighty-four per cent of businesses in Guinea experience electrical outages, suffering four electrical outages a month, resulting in a 5 per cent loss of annual sales.The TPC project will provide a medium-term and mid-priced power solution to support the country's post-Ebola economic recovery until further hydropower resource comes on stream.  This privately funded power project, designed to deliver international environmental standards, will be a strong signal to attract other international investors to the country.

EAVF seeks to invest in companies that tackle this challenge.  Our investment will enable the fund manager to target growing energy infrastructure businesses which tap into new technology or innovative business models to address the problem of electricity shortages across the continent.  It will do this by providing electricity and energy-efficient solutions for underserved households and businesses. The fund focuses specifically on off-grid rural electrification.  EAVF investments include Off-Grid Electric (OGE), a pioneering off-grid electric company providing clean, affordable solar power to homes in East Africa. The investment enabled OGE to increase its work in Tanzania, as well as enter the Rwandan market to make solar technology accessible to households without electricity.

In 2014 and 2015, the state diverted nearly all fuel to electricity generation to meet peak summer power demand supplying to household consumers at the expense of heavy industry. These power shortages severely limit the country's economic potential.Our investment will generate 390MW of solar power and support 3,000 jobs during the construction phase. The project is located in Upper Egypt which suffers from the highest rates of unemployment and poverty in the country.  It is expected to provide clean, cost-effective power to over 350,000 residential customers.The Egyptian government foresees 20 per cent of its power production originating from renewable sources by 2022. A large portion will be in the form of solar projects but wind is projected to play an increasing role over the next five years. The promotion of renewable energy will help to develop another local source of energy supply, reducing the country's import fuel bill, as well as meeting increased demand.

USAID Clean Power Asia (CPA) has commenced work with the GoL on a pilot auction for utility-scale solar. They have an agreement in place with the GOL for the project and therefore GOL has asked GGGI to coordinate our support with CPA. Specifically, the GOL has requested GGGI's support and collaboration with USAID Clean Power Asia to complete the following: 1. conduct a site selection assessment to help the government of Lao PDR identify multiple sites to comprise an auction of 40 MW of solar PV, 2. develop technical specifications for solar PV that will be used for the auction, and can be used to guide the development of future solar projects, and, 3. to design an appropriate risk mitigation mechanism (for off-taker risk) to be incorporated into tender documents for the auction process. The site selection assessment will consider environmental and social impacts and make recommendations that will minimize the negative impacts. Protected areas and land with historical or cultural significance will be excluded. It is expected that the 40 MW auction will be comprised of multiple sites due to grid capacities, therefore no large land concessions are expected.|2.3||0||||||| ...

The Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan highlights that only 5% of the population (about 300 Mio. people) of rural areas in the  region has any access to electricity. SADC Member States have an excellent solar irradiation and estimates suggest that solar thermal systems could meet about 70 – 80% of the regions low temperature heating and cooling demand. By investing in  solar thermal systems the SOLTRAIN partner countries could avoid significant investment and running cost for power plants as well as for fuel imports. The impact of SOLTRAIN III is to contribute to a renewable energy supply system, in  particular solar thermal, thus contributing to poverty reduction.

Established in 2013, Brookings India is the third and newest overseas center of the Washington, D.C.-based Brookings Institution. Viable utilities underpin one of India's longstanding ambitions, namely to provide reliable electricity to all its citizens, and are critical to advancing the nation's climate and economic development goals.

At the same time, India's grid is modernizing, garnering significant capital investment as the nation continues to expand electricity access. Brookings India examines the regulatory, political, and economic contexts under which utilities in India operate to help improve the information available to policymakers, utility operators, and consumers.|13||0||||||||||||0|0|0||2017-12-12||||||||||||||||

Project aims: (1) demonstrate a strong urban case for a rapid-phase out of coal-fired electricity generation, and (2) utilise the research results for an effective advocacy and communications campaign at COP26. In the research project, C40 will estimate the contribution of coal combustion for C40 city electricity generation to global GHG emissions, to air quality-related health burdens in C40 cities, to COVID-19-related health impacts as well as analyse the economic benefits of different coal phase-out scenarios by looking at: (1) the economic value of improved health associated with reduced coal combustion for electricity generation in C40 cities, and (2) the number of net jobs that are generated with a switch from coal combustion to clean energy.|3.9,17,13||0||||||||||||0|1|0||2020-09-30||||||||||||||||

The EDISON software platform handles automated data collection, storage, access, analysis and visualization to verify the installation and use of solar systems under BGFZ's performance-based financing mechanism. Analyses based on EDISON also feed into the dialogue platform established by the Ministry of Energy in Zambia that brings together Zambian authorities, donors, development banks and energy services companies in Zambia.An expansion of the results-based financing mechanism tested in Zambia is now applied in the new contribution Beyond the Grid Fund for Africa, where the Nordic Environment Financing Corporation is the agreement partner. This will provide the opportunity to collect similar data in Burkina Faso, Liberia and Mozambique reaching an additional 1 to 3 million customers. At the same t ...
