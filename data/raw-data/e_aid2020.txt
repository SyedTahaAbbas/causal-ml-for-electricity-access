General Environment Protection|61000|Private sector in provider country|Econoler Inc.|61000||||2017-12-01|2020-12-01|Sound energy efficiency policies play a critical role in fighting climate change. They are considered vital to reducing energy bills and reducing emissions and air pollution, while also improving energy security and sovereignty, and increasing access to energy. However, there are still significant barriers to the effective implementation of inclusive energy-efficient policies in developing countries. Women in rural areas are particularly affected by poor access to reliable energy sources such as electricity, thus forcing households to turn to biofuels such as wood and dung to cook, light, and warm their homes. This energy poverty remains one of the most formidable challenges to any progress in global development. Although a growing body of literature is emerging on how improved energy efficiency and reduced energy demand generate climate benefits, there is still a lack of empirical evidence on how to deliver the scale and speed required.   This project is being implemented by Quebec-based Econoler Inc., which specializes in the development and implementation of energy efficiency and clean energy production. It is aimed at identifying energy efficiency measures and exploring options to improve inclusiveness in access and decision-making in rural areas of West African countries as a combined mitigation (reduction of emissio ...

Energy Policy|22000|Donor country-based NGO|Innovations for Poverty Action, a non-profit corporation|22000||||2019-09-01|2022-09-01|Myanmar's population is primarily rural, characterized by agriculture-dominated economies and resource-dependent livelihoods. Approximately 60% of the country's rural population lacks access to electricity and clean cooking. However, this situation is expected to change with the ongoing implementation of the government's National Electrification Plan, which aims to electrify all households by 2030 through grid and off-grid infrastructures. Unfortunately, while off-grid renewable energy systems are scaling up, rigorous impact evaluations of the benefits from off-grid electrification in resource-constrained settings are sparse, and gender-differentiated benefits almost non-existent. This is particularly important when considering that rural communities, women and children in particular, are extremely vulnerable to global and regional climate change-related risks. Without such evaluations, the implementation and sustainability of mini-grid systems in rural communities can be impeded.   The project seeks to answer two broad questions: First, does electricity supplied through off/mini-grid renewables benefit households in rural communities? Second, are these benefits equitably distributed across income groups, gender, and ethnicity? The project will conduct a multi-stage diagnosis-design-test framework to measure the impacts of off/mini-grid renewables using an experimental design with treatment and control populations stratified ...

After years of high-impact research and successful engagement with local and national authorities, the Nairobi County government declared a special planning area for Mukuru in August 2017. The special planning area froze development in Mukuru while a consortium of forty local organizations developed an integrated development plan. In recent months, as part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nairobi Metropolitan Services has started implementing the plan and allocated $12 million for infrastructure development during the current financial year. This project will support the efforts of Akiba Mashinani Trust to document and disseminate lessons learned from an innovative and transformational process to redevelop the Mukuru informal settlement. Through field research, policy engagement meetings, workshops, and dissemination events, the project aims to capture first efforts to implement the special planning area redevelopment plan.

Technology and personnel gaps in this sector also have an adverse effect on progress towards several Sustainable Development Goals linked to access to reliable electricity from national grids and micro-grids, both of which are increasingly using solar photovoltaic panels.   Senegal has emerged as a leader in solar electricity in West Africa, where there has been significant recent growth. This project will strengthen linkages between universities and the private sector in the solar energy sector in Senegal, where the current supply of skills, technologies, and knowledge does not meet the demand.   The project is co-funded by Meridiam, a leading solar energy production company in Senegal. It will address the lack of skilled labour in solar energy within the national electricity provider (Senelec), and it will contribute to training other technicians across the country. Both of these modules will be designed as new certificate courses, developed in con ...

Food losses and waste result from to many reasons, which include inadequate infrastructure and lack or unreliable energy supply, lack of skills and access to markets. A key contributor to food loss in developing countries and in particular Africa and India is the very limited availability of cold food chains for the preservation and temperature controlled distribution of fresh produce to markets.   The Sol-Tech project aims to make a contribution to addressing the food waste challenge and key Sustainable Development Challenges and Goals, including halving food waste by 2030, providing access to energy for all and alleviation of poverty and malnutrition. This will be achieved by building on previous and current research to develop to commercialisation stage an innovative but affordable solar powered modular fresh food cold storage and first mile distribution system for application in areas with no or limited and unreliable access to the electricity grid. Sol-Tech will involve col ...

Currently, about one-half Africa's total population is lacking access to electricity. However, the continent is well endowed with renewable energy resources, it is estimated that about 35% of the world resources for wind energy are located in the continent. There are many challenges which hinder the development of infrastructure for wind energy in Africa. Designing suitable foundations to sustain the loads typically applied by wind turbines represents a particular challenge. Most potential locations for wind turbines in Africa are in tropical zones where fluctuation in ground water level is severe. The cycling of water levels means that many deposits of interest are unsaturated for at least part of the year. Unsaturated soils exhibit complex mechanical behaviour, coupled to changes in water content. This research aims to provide design for the foundations of wind turbines in unsaturated soils.|||0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1||||0|0|0|0|||||||||||||||||

The UN's 'Cooling for All' coalition estimates that 1.1 billion people worldwide have little or no access to cooling to protect them against extreme heat .  Those defined as most at risk include 630 million people across South Asia, South East Asia and Sub Saharan Africa who live in poor quality housing on low incomes, with limited, intermittent or insecure access to electricity and few if any electrical cooling appliances. Current global and national frameworks for action on heat in global cities categorise the negative effects of heat on these urban residents as either a public health issue (i.e. leading to heat illness, dehydration and disease) or an economic issue (i.e. leading to a decline in employment, worker productivity and output). Yet this categorisation significantly limits the way that frameworks for action on heat account for socio-economic inequality and gender.  In some countries, like India and Pakistan, international and national frameworks for responding to extreme heat in cities have led to urban heat action plans and public awareness raising. However, action on overheating by city planners and policy makers remains typically top-down and technology driven, frequently challenged by silo-ed agendas, unexamined assumptions about energy cul ...

Latterly, policies and regulations to facilitate energy transition toward low-carbon generation of energy have on the whole been designed for industrial countries, and then transferred to major developing countries with some success in major emerging countries (for instance in South Africa). These approaches have so far achieved little impact in Least Developed and low-income countries. This is mainly due to the relative weakness of their institutions and of attendant regulatory architectures, and a lack of adequate governance structures to implement them. In the case of many African countries, moreover, planning for energy transitions is made more complicated by the competing priority of increasing access to modern energy services, as well as by the political economy competition between centralised, clientelist states and varying degrees of initiatives towards decentralization and devolution of powers towards local governance structures.   RETs production and deployment have risen substantially globally, on the back of huge industrialisation and subsequent cost reductions in the order of 80%. In many low-middle and middle-income developing countries the  ...

It will build a partnership between world leading scientists in Africa and the UK who specialise in two strands of science, developing and characterising novel energy materials (catalysts and photovoltaics) and structural biology (understanding disease and developing drug targets). In START the research direction will be set by considering the local environment and through engagement with scientists, energy industry representatives and relevant non-governmental organisations (NGO's) across Africa.  Most importantly, START is not only about developing new energy materials or structural biology research, equally important is training the next generation of researchers and research leaders in these important areas of study. We will work together in sample fabrication and advanced characterisation through training visits between African and UK institutes. This will include experimental time at Diamond Light Source (the UK national synchrotron source) through peer reviewed access to many of the experimental facilities and in techniques that are the mainstay of understanding these materials. A major ambition of this partnership is to strengthen and broaden the network of synchrotron researchers in Africa, where there is a burgeoning a ...

India, the main focus of the project, faces a unique challenge in energising both urban and rural communities. Current options for low cost power almost exclusively involve burning substances to release power. This is unsustainable since India will require 1000GW installed new electricity capacity alone by 2030 if it is to meet its growth projections. In rural Indian communities, pollution is also produced from burning crops and animal waste which, combined with urban fossil fuel use, produces choking smog in its big cities. Our project aims to deliver locally manufactured solutions for low-cost solar electricity generation to deliver environmental and energy benefits. By providing affordable solutions to solar generation, which can be combined with storage, simple solutions of night-time lighting and power can be delivered.

The envisioned holistic hybrid MGs will lead to a prototype model for the creation of sustainable and resilient distribution networks for off-grid locations. This approach has the potential to enable electrification of millions of households. Both Tanzania and Uganda are low income 'least developed' countries with a high level of rural poverty and very limited grid co ...

The way they are tackled impacts on the sustainable infrastructure of our planet. One of the most significant global development challenges is how we mitigate against the proliferation of energy intensive air-conditioning (AC) for cooling and ventilation in buildings in response to a globally warming world and the greater expectations for thermal comfort in buildings that accompany growing affluence. This is particularly pertinent in developing countries such as India as disposable income increases, making AC more easily accessible. Many of India's most populous metropolitan areas such as Mumbai, Chennai and Calcutta have hot and humid climates, and are seeing growth rates in the use of AC of approximately 30% per year. The electricity demand for space cooling comprises up to 60% of the summer peak load in large cities such as New Delhi, and most air-conditioners are inefficient and use refrigerants with high GWP (global warming potential). A solution to this problem is needed urgently. This makes energy efficiency and thermal comfort a priority area for the Indian government in recent revisions of its National Building and Energy Conservation Building Codes which emphasise the need to design buildings for natural v ...

In fact, around a third of Mexican households are unable to access an adequate level of energy services. Similarly, annual energy supply interruptions in Colombia add up to 38 hours per year. However, energy services are essential to wellbeing. Indeed, access to adequate, reliable, affordable and clean energy services underpins a range of human capabilities and when unmet, results in a situation of energy vulnerability (EV). A shortfall in realised energy services can be caused by various socio-technical, institutional and environmental factors, including: unreliable or poor quality infrastructure, gendered differences in energy access and use, high energy prices, social isolation, and stressors caused by intensifying climatic changes. The impacts of this are wide ranging, from adverse health, wellbeing, and social participation outcomes, to limited economic development.   There are no official EV-related strategies in the three countries, and each one is at a different stage in addressing the issue. I ...

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the most energy-deprived region in the world, arguably constitutes the greatest obstacle for realising these goals. An estimated 700 million people in SSA - the majority of them in rural areas -lack electricity access, a number that is only expected to rise as the continent's rural population growth outpaces capacity growth. The three SDG dimensions of achieving energy access - affordability, reliability and sustainability - each stand in stark contrast to the status quo: while the cost of electricity in SSA can be orders of magnitude higher than in industrialised countries, blackouts are frequent, and less than a quarter of energy supply comes from renewable sources. Energy poverty has impaired SSA's economic development since its independence in the 1960s, indicating that new approaches are urgently required.   Given the extent of rural energy poverty, limited rural purchasing power and logistical difficulties, innovative, locally driven business models for the renewable energy sector are required to achieve comprehensive rural electrificati ...

They are left with a gap that can lead to a loss of income and poverty. It can cause a lot of family pressures, especially for girls are left to care for younger children and are not able to go to school. Many of these families come from communities that are already poor, with very little infrastructure and limited access to decent healthcare. This can cause a much higher risk of death, both for mothers and babies, especially in poor countries. Opportunities are more limited because families lack money and education.  Myanmar is a South East Asian country that has had many years of tension and conflict between the different people groups. Many of these groups live in remote mountainous areas where basic resources and infrastructure such as electricity are limited. There is often little healthcare in these areas with very few doctors, nurses or midwives to care for mothers and their families.  One in 23 women in Eastern Myanmar either die or come close to death during pregnancy or childbirth. These challenges are all very typical in developing countries across the world today, but a lot can be changed with education that makes sense to mothers and families in their situations.  Working together with our local partners we intend to ...

This will add more than 10 Mega Watts (MW) to the country's power generation capacity of an estimated average peak demand requirement of 300-500 MW. There will be a welfare increase in rural communities in terms of saved fuel costs, improved health and education outcomes, improved communications and access to information and health and safety.

Proving secure and affordable energy infrastructure is crucial to promoting inclusive development of rural communities in this region, and solar power is a sustainable way of achieving this. However, ground mounted arrays of solar panels also remove land from food production at a time when crop yields are threatened by a changing climate and increasing populations, insecure ownership and land 'grabbing' are putting pressure on land resources. In practice, economic growth linked to conventional solar arrays may be outweighed by reduced income from crop production and greater food insecurity. Renewable energy technologies which resolve energy, climate and land security conflicts are urgently needed. So called agrivoltiac (AV) systems permit the delivery of solar electricity, crop production, and rainwater harvesting on the same land area. Instead of being ground mounted, arrays are several meters high, enabling crops to be grown underneath. In locations with high light intensity, high temperature, and low rainfall, such as many places in East Africa, the productivity of crops grown beneath these e ...

The project also promotes energy efficiency and the development of renewable energies. Ghana is considered as one of the most stable countries in western Africa, characterized by a strong democratic rule of law and a relatively robust economic growth. To secure the country stability and support further growth, it is imperative for Ghana to address the weaknesses of the power sector, notably by increasing electricity generation capacity and reinforcing and extending the reach of the electricity distribution network. Cases in point are that today only about 62% of households nationwide have access to electricity, and urban growth is triggering a steep increase in electricity demand.|7.b,16,13||0|1|2|||0|||||||0|1|0|0|2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

Ces enjeux font partie des priorités du Rwanda. Ainsi, l'énergie est une des priorités de la « Vision 2020 », par laquelle le Rwanda cherche à devenir un pays à revenus moyens en 2020. Cette vision se traduit en divers plans stratégiques dont le dernier est l'Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy II (EDPRS II 2012-2017) qui explique que « la croissance économique, parmi d'autres choses, sera poussée par la fourniture ininterrompue d'énergie à des prix qui seront stables et régionalement compétitifs ». L'accès à des sources modernes d'énergie à des prix abordables sera crucial si le pays veut réaliser ses objectifs de développement. Cette volonté se traduit dans le plan stratégique sectoriel 2013-2018 (Annexe 8) où le Rwanda vise un mix énergétique au niveau de la production et une augmentation de l'accès à l'énergie. En regard de l'EDPRS II, le plan stratégique prévoit 1) une augmentation des capacités de production électrique, notamment au travers des énergies renouvelables, 2) une augmentation de l'accès à l'électricité, 3) de garantir et de maintenir des tarifs compétitifs au niveau régional. La Stratégie du Rwanda est donc de garantir la « provision de fournitures énergétiques en suffisance, ...

As the use of renewable energy - in particular photovoltaics - is now a cost-optimized option in many off-grid settings, solar electricity will be used for many electrification projects. A central precondition for the successful implementation of these political targets is the use of safe, high-quality components and systems for renewable energy that are adapted to international standards. For this to be possible, the national Quality Infrastructure (QI) has to render internationally recognized and demand-oriented services. The national quality infrastructure comprises metrology, standardization and testing, as well as conformity assessment, certification and accreditation.Currently, demand-oriented, recognized services are not provided in the national QI, or are not used effectively - as a result, the potential of photovoltaics is not sufficiently exploited.|||0|1|1||0||||1||||0|2|0|0|2017-01-01||||||||||||||||

The national electricity market will be opened up to competition and renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) will be promoted. To achieve this, the Grenadian government will be supported in revising and amending legal principles, starting a dialog process with the main electricity supplier, developing a road map for greater use of RE and EE, and establishing an exchange platform for investors in RE and EE areas. This approach can potentially point the way forward for other regions. Alongside the reduction of direct greenhouse-gas emissions, this project will reduce dependency on oil imports and consequently the burden on the government budget, the population and the private sector. EE measures and  green marketing  will help strengthen the tourism, agriculture and light industry sectors, and create jobs.|||0|0|0||0||||1||||0|2|0|0|2015-02-26||||||||||||||||

Decentralized photovoltaic (PV) installations, especially on roofs, have a particularly high potential in the solar electricity generation sector. The project combines climate and energy policies, particularly in urban development. It supports key climate and energy policy stakeholders (mainly distribution network operators) in the transition to a low-emission energy sector with the aim of achieving the national climate targets and NDC s. The project also develops framework conditions for a decentralised PV energy supply, demonstrating its feasibility by means of a prototype. In addition, the economic and technical advantages of a rapid expansion are clearly shown, and recommendations to support the expansion of PV rooftop installations are being developed and implemented together with pilot cities in the Indian Smart Cities Programme.|||0|1|1||0||||1||||0|2|0|0|2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

Part of the German Climate Technology Initiative, the project supports the government in the effective implementation of the Solar Plan and thus in the expansion of renewable energies on a large scale. This is done at several levels in the technical components of the project, through policy advice, for example, that is aimed at developing effective regulations. The implementation of the Solar Plan is accompanied by continuous macro-economic analyses, the results of which are incorporated into the energy and low emission strategies which are continuously adapted – and the advice provided on how to establish a regulator in the electricity sector will result in more intensive competition.Through further training and accompanying support, the project also strengthens the competences of specialists and managers from participating institutions and Tunisian private companies.|||0|1|0||0||||1||||0|2|0|0|2015-08-26||||||||||||||||

The impact of the mobility options will be considered, improved and analysed in a holistic way - from the production and design of the vehicles, to the energy supply and the recycling of the vehicles and the energy supply infrastructure. In the framework of a pilot implementation in Ghana at the site of the local partner Don Bosco, a sharing system for e-mopeds and cargo bikes will be tested technically and economically and adapted in consideration of local conditions and user requirements. Sustainable mobility needs to be planned in connection with renewable energy supply. Therefore, a smart mini-grid of solar systems and charging stations will be developed within the project. This mini-grid, unlike stand-alone systems, has sufficient power to supply the e-vehicles.Part of the mini-grid is an automated metering of the vehicles' electricity consumption and smart demand management through real-time adjustment of the electricity price to supply, demand, weather and battery status. The aim is to intensify the use of sustainable mobility alternatives and at the same time to contribute to the improved access to reliable and sustainable energy.

The industrial park and the adjoining campus of the Catholic University are supplied with energy by means of small hydropower plants and solar modules. By generating electricity based on  renewable energy sources (PV solar and hydropower modules) and the co-neutrality of mudbrick building, a contribution to climate protection is made. The treatment, bottling and sale of locally obtained drinking water ensures a contribution to  the local drinking water supply. The project corresponds to Nigeria's Climate Change Policy Response and Strategy NDC, as adopted in 2012, e.g. its' strategic goal to foster low-carbon, high growth economic development and build a climate  resilient society.

The development objective of the intervention is poverty alleviation in rural mainland Tanzania through the providing of access to modern energy services based on renewable resources. Lack of access to electricity has been shown and is widely accepted as one of the main constraints to growth.REA was established in 2007 under the Rural Energy Act to promote and facilitate access to modern energy services in rural areas of mainland Tanzania by providing grants, subsidies and capacity building to developers of rural energy projects. The ambition in Tanzania is to increase energy access in the rural areas from 21% in 2014 to 50% per cent by 2020. In this regard REF is key to reach those results.The overall objective of the proposed programme is to contribute to the Tanzanian Government's aim to reach the UN initiative Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) ambition of universal energy access by 2030.

However given the current lack of transport infrastructure and electricity they cannot be preserved and will perish. The overall purpose of this project is to develop and implement a low cost, and robust solar fruit preservation technology that can enhance local food and economic security without depending on the co-development of infrastructure. In the first part of this project, prototype pouches of breathable material have been developed and demonstrated how to concentrate fruit juice using only solar energy. The pouches allows water to evaporate, but protects the juice from contamination by microorganisms and insects. During evaporation the sugar concentration will increase and as most fruits have low pH it becomes storage stable (i.e. halts microbial growth) and can be stored in the household for the lean season, or sold to earn cash. Finally, specific strains of Lactobacillus can be used to improve the taste, and other strains can improve digestion or destruct undesirable substances as phytates, tannins, and polyphenols.  Methods: -Optimize design with respect to drying rate, hea ...

With average hurricane force winds over 170 km/h and gusts up to 240 km/h, the cyclone caused widespread destruction across the Central, Eastern, and Western divisions in Fiji.  Many small and remote islands lay in the direct path of TC Harold. It is estimated that more than 182,500 people in Fiji (or around 20% of the population) were directly affected. Destructive winds, storm surges and flooding from TC Harold destroyed villages, homes and government buildings, and severely damaged agriculture and infrastructure, including for water supply, waste and sanitation, electricity, and communications. An estimated 90% of crops have been destroyed in the most affected areas, leaving families with no alternative food source. Outbreaks of typhoid, leptospirosis, and dengue fever have been identified by the Ministry of Health as a major concern.A state of natural disaster was declared for the affected divisions in Fiji on 12 April 2020. The NDMO is coordinating and monitoring relief efforts which are being undertaken by government agencies and local and international nongovernmental organizations. This  has been particularly challenging given the remoteness of affected islands, travel restrictions due to COVID-19 outbreak, disruption to communication channels, limited number of boat vessels undertaking assessments, and stretched human resources.|||0||||||||||||||||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

The Second Green Power Development Project is building a run-of-the-river hydropower plant in central Bhutan through a partnership with several private companies. Clean power generated by the plant will be sold to India and will help reduce carbon emissions. The clean energy from Bhutan will allow India to eliminate around 460,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year that it would otherwise have generated through fossil fuels. The revenue generated from exporting power to India will be used to finance social services in Bhutan such as health, education and rural development. The planned 118-megawatt plant will be located on the Nikachhu River in a narrow valley in the central Trongsa District. As a run-of-the-river plant, it does not need a large reservoir for water storage, but comprehensive safeguard management plans are provisioned for the project implementation.|||1||||||||||||||||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

Diversification of the generation mix primarily to renewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, reduced technical losses and supply and demand side management is the only way to correct this situation. The transmission network needs expansion and modernization, particularly in the former conflict-affected areas in Northern and Eastern provinces. The 33 kilovolt (kV) medium voltage (MV) network needs to expand power supply into rural areas where many households have poor reliability and inadequate quality of electricity supply. For sustainable functioning of the power sector, the government pursues financial, managerial, and institutional reforms in line ...

ADB has supported Tajikistan power sector reforms through the ongoing Sector Operation Performance Improvements (SOPI) program, which has built the basis for the fundamental reform program of PSDP that includes unbundling of the vertically integrated power utility company, restructuring of the utility's excessive liabilities, establishment of a regulator, adoption of a tariff methodology, and establishment of a new centralized cash control system among unbundled entities. As a part of reforms and institutional capacity building, a newly established power distribution company will be given a 5-year management contract. Investments in the retail advanced metering system in Dushanbe and 6 other cities will also fill the key deficiencies in the sector's power loss accounting and bill collection systems. The program is included in the Country Operations Business Plan, 2019-2021. A separately approved transaction technical assistance facility (FTRTA) will be used to finalize due diligence activities.|9.1,7.3,7.1,5,13.a,12.7,12.6,12.2,10.2,1.4||1||||||||||||||||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

The clean energy from Bhutan will allow India to eliminate around 460,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year that it would otherwise have generated through fossil fuels. The revenue generated from exporting power to India will be used to finance social services in Bhutan such as health, education and rural development. The planned 118-megawatt plant will be located on the Nikachhu River in a narrow valley in the central Trongsa District. As a run-of-the-river plant, it does not need a large reservoir for water storage, but comprehensive safeguard management plans are provisioned for the project implementation.|||1||||||||||||||||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

The clean energy from Bhutan will allow India to eliminate around 460,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year that it would otherwise have generated through fossil fuels. The revenue generated from exporting power to India will be used to finance social services in Bhutan such as health, education and rural development. The planned 118-megawatt plant will be located on the Nikachhu River in a narrow valley in the central Trongsa District.

Energy Policy|12000|Recipient Government|Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA)|12000||||||Electricity is a necessary requirement for accelerating the economic development of any country and is considered an important input to improve quality of life. Overall, the electricity demand has far outgrown the supply, leading to load curtailment and increased dependence on imports from India in recent times. The peak suppressed demand in Nepal in FY2013?2014 has been around 1,200 megawatt (MW) as against installed capacity of 787 MW, hence resulting in a deficit of about 440 MW due to non-availability of generation. Government has plans to generate additional 10,000 MW in the next 10 years. About 63% of the population in Nepal has access to electricity but the supply quality is unreliable and inadequate. The government has recognized the immediate need for reinforcement and upgrade of outdated distribution systems crucial to deliver the required energy to the customers even if the generation and transmission lines are in place. In this regard, the need for immediate distribution network enhancement is included in the government?s action plan to address energy crisis and provide universal access to reliable and efficient electricity for all by 2030. This will contribute in promoting sustainable energy for all (Sustainable Development Goal #7) and Nepal?s Intended Nationally Determined Commitments for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.<br><br>ADB?s Nepal country partnership strategy 2013?2017 supports the government's development objective of ac ...

There are 66 national poverty counties and 131 provincial poverty counties in the four participating provinces, with a poor population of about 9 million. About 43% of the project s subprojects are located in these poor counties. The project consists of four components: (i) sustainable development and demonstration of commercial practices of medium- and large-scale biogas plants (MLBGPs), (ii) effective utilization of biogas sludge in eco-farming, (iii) capacity development for improved sector performance, and (iv) project implementation support. The project will assist about 118 medium-sized and large livestock farms and agro-enterprises in constructing biogas plants, and introduce a new technical specification to the plant design. The new specification involves the installation of high-temperature flares in the MLBGPs to minimize the methane gas emissions during maintenance and emergency this has been a common standard in developed countries but not yet in the PRC. The project will also demonstrate business models of centralized biogas plant systems to improve their cost-effectiveness, and technical and environmental performances, and assist 25 subprojects to overcome barriers to c ...

EESL was set up as a government-owned energy services company (ESCO) to facilitate energy efficiency investments, including work designing, implementing, monitoring and investing in energy efficiency projects. ADB?s loan will cover high-priority areas under EESL?s ESCO business namely through use of: (i) more efficient light-emitting diode (LED) municipal street lighting equipped with remote operating technology, (ii) more efficient domestic lighting and fans through replacement of incandescent lights with LEDs and more efficient fans, and (iii) more energy efficient agricultural water pumps. EESL estimates that energy savings of 80% can be achieved in the domestic lighting programs and 30% can be achieved with more efficient pumps. Savings will result in lower electricity bills for consumers, peak power shaving, and reduced commercial losses for distribution companies. The project will also demonstrate the potential for energy efficiency achievements and scalability of the ESCO model for realizing energy savings in India.|||||||||||||||1||||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

The results obtained will serve as input for the preparation of the following documents: i) Challenges for the development of the Country (CDC, for its acronym in English) and ii) Agenda for the Growth of the Andean Region. In the last decade, Bolivia has made important progress in reducing poverty. For example, moderate poverty went from 60% to 36% between 2006 and 2017 and extreme poverty from 38% to 17%. However, these advances also generate another kind of pressure from a new middle class that tends to migrate from the countryside to the city, concentrating on peri-urban areas and often facing problems related to the lack of quality public services (water, electricity, health, housing, security, etc.), as well as the difficulty to find sources of work in conditions of formality. The rapid growth of the middle class poses challenges such as: the generation of modern, versatile and quality information on poverty, the study of the characteristics of this new population, its main needs and vulnerabilities, as well as a diagnosis of the capacity that can be have the main public institutions to meet the demands of this sector of citizenship.|||||||||||||||||||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

Energy poverty is an emergent concept that gained a lot of interest since the publication of the Sustainable Development Goals. Before 2005 few works exist on the matter, energy poverty was first defined as a lack of access to electricity and clean energy for heating and cookingor as an inability to meet basic energy needs. However, in the last 10 years, the term energy poverty was generalized to mean fuel poverty and to point out issues of affordability and efficiency in developed countries. My work consisted of understanding the different definitions of energy poverty and in analyzing the different indicators used to measure it. Also, I analyzed the sustainable Goal number 7 called affordable and clean energy.The researcher stayed at the UC3M between September 2019 and january 2020|4.B||1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1||||0|0|0|0|2019-09-02||||||||||||||||

The specific objective is to stimulate and demonstrate the financial viability of private investments in electric vehicles (EVs). To this end, the program will provide access to long-term financing for private-led EV projects, channeled by Peru's National Development Bank, COFIDE. COFIDE will use Clean Technology Fund (CTF) concessional loan resources blended with IDB resources to provide long-term financing for EV projects, including: (i) replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles with EVs, with particular emphasis on passenger transport operated by private actors (mainly buses, taxis and three-wheeled moto-taxis), and (ii) EV charging stations, preferably renewable-energy-powered. This twofold target of the financing aims to offer a holistic support, addressing demand and supply of clean electricity in the EV market in unison.|||||||||||||||||||2020-12-31||||||||||||||||

They are considered vital to reducing energy bills and reducing emissions and air pollution, while also improving energy security and sovereignty, and increasing access to energy. However, there are still significant barriers to the effective implementation of inclusive energy-efficient policies in developing countries. Women in rural areas are particularly affected by poor access to reliable energy sources such as electricity, thus forcing households to turn to biofuels such as wood and dung to cook, light, and warm their homes. This energy poverty remains one of the most formidable challenges to any progress in global development. Although a growing body of literature is emerging on how improved energy efficiency and reduced energy demand generate climate benefits, there is still a lack of empirical evidence on how to deliver the scale and speed required.   This project is being implemented by Quebec-based Econoler Inc., which specializes in the development and implementation of energy efficiency and clean energy production. It is aimed at identifying energy efficiency measures and exploring options to improve inclusiveness in access and decision-making in rural areas of West African countries as a ...

There are well-documented labour shortages in these fields in West and Central Africa, which present barriers to the development and application of new technologies and the growth of emerging sectors such as clean energy. Technology and personnel gaps in this sector also have an adverse effect on progress towards several Sustainable Development Goals linked to access to reliable electricity from national grids and micro-grids, both of which are increasingly using solar photovoltaic panels. Senegal has emerged as a leader in solar electricity in West Africa, where there has been significant recent growth. This project will strengthen linkages between universities and the private sector in the solar energy sector in Senegal, where the current supply of skills, technologies, and knowledge does not meet the demand. The project is co-funded by Meridiam, a leading solar energy production company in Senegal. It will address the lack of skilled labour in solar energy within the national electricity provider (Senelec), and it will contribute to training other technicians across the country. Both of these modules will be designed as new certificate courses, developed in conju ...

There are well-documented labour shortages in these fields in West and Central Africa, which present barriers to the development and application of new technologies and the growth of emerging sectors such as clean energy. Technology and personnel gaps in this sector also have an adverse effect on progress towards several Sustainable Development Goals linked to access to reliable electricity from national grids and micro-grids, both of which are increasingly using solar photovoltaic panels. Senegal has emerged as a leader in solar electricity in West Africa, where there has been significant recent growth. This project will strengthen linkages between universities and the private sector in the solar energy sector in Senegal, where the current supply of skills, technologies, and knowledge does not meet the demand. The project is co-funded by Meridiam, a leading solar energy production company in Senegal. It will address the lack of skilled labour in solar energy within the national electricity provider (Senelec), and it will contribute to training other technicians across the country. Both of these modules will be designed as new certificate courses, developed in conjunc ...

Local industry runs on expensive diesel, or on charcoal that is made from trees illegally felled inside the park (providing a major source of income for armed groups). Reliable electricity supply from Virunga is expected to boost business activity to provide sustainable livelihoods. In turn, it is hoped that this will provide an attractive alternative for at-risk youth through skills development and employment opportunities. This was the first concession agreement under the liberalised energy law introduced in 2014 (CDC funded legal support to Virunga for this process). By the end of 2017, over 4,000 customers had been connected to Virunga's grid, including households, small to medium-sized enterprises and social infrastructure.New businesses are being formed and several customers have moved their operations to access Virunga's power. Public lighting has been provided for the first time in villages close to one of Virunga's plants, increasing safety.

EAVF seeks to invest in companies that tackle this challenge.  Our investment will enable the fund manager to target growing energy infrastructure businesses which tap into new technology or innovative business models to address the problem of electricity shortages across the continent.  It will do this by providing electricity and energy-efficient solutions for underserved households and businesses. The fund focuses specifically on off-grid rural electrification.  EAVF investments include Off-Grid Electric (OGE), a pioneering off-grid electric company providing clean, affordable solar power to homes in East Africa. The investment enabled OGE to increase its work in Tanzania, as well as enter the Rwandan market to make solar technology accessible to households without electricity.

In 2014 and 2015, the state diverted nearly all fuel to electricity generation to meet peak summer power demand supplying to household consumers at the expense of heavy industry. These power shortages severely limit the country's economic potential.Our investment will generate 390MW of solar power and support 3,000 jobs during the construction phase. The project is located in Upper Egypt which suffers from the highest rates of unemployment and poverty in the country.  It is expected to provide clean, cost-effective power to over 350,000 residential customers.The Egyptian government foresees 20 per cent of its power production originating from renewable sources by 2022. A large portion will be in the form of solar projects but wind is projected to play an increasing role over the next five years. The promotion of renewable energy will help to develop another local source of energy supply, reducing the country's import fuel bill, as well as meeting increased demand.

Le projet est financé à 75:25 en dette et equity, avec la dette prise en charge à 50:50 entre Proparco et la BERD. La contribution Proparco bénéficie d'une sous-participation AFD de 50%. La centrale produira 138 GWh d'électricité décarbonée par an. Elle permettra d'éviter l'émission de 58 800 tonnes de CO2 chaque année. Le projet améliorera la qualité et la sécurité de fourniture d'électricité dans le pays. Enfin, le projet soutiendra la création ou le maintien de plus de 4 000 emplois dans l'ensemble de l'économie egyptienne et devrait contribuer au PIB national à hauteur de 28 MEUR sur la durée de vie du projet.|11||0|0|||||0||||1|||0|0||2017-08-18||||||||||||3|Non ODA PSI|3||La centrale produira 138 GWh d'électricité décarbonée par an.

USAID Clean Power Asia (CPA) has commenced work with the GoL on a pilot auction for utility-scale solar. They have an agreement in place with the GOL for the project and therefore GOL has asked GGGI to coordinate our support with CPA. Specifically, the GOL has requested GGGI's support and collaboration with USAID Clean Power Asia to complete the following: 1. conduct a site selection assessment to help the government of Lao PDR identify multiple sites to comprise an auction of 40 MW of solar PV, 2. develop technical specifications for solar PV that will be used for the auction, and can be used to guide the development of future solar projects, and, 3. to design an appropriate risk mitigation mechanism (for off-taker risk) to be incorporated into tender documents for the auction process. The site selection assessment will consider environmental and social impacts and make recommendations that will minimize the negative impacts. Protected areas and land with historical or cultural significance will be excluded. It is expected that the 40 MW auction will be comprised of multiple sites due to grid capacities, therefore no large land concessions are expected.|2.3||0||||||| ...

The Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan highlights that only 5% of the population (about 300 Mio. people) of rural areas in the  region has any access to electricity. SADC Member States have an excellent solar irradiation and estimates suggest that solar thermal systems could meet about 70 – 80% of the regions low temperature heating and cooling demand. By investing in  solar thermal systems the SOLTRAIN partner countries could avoid significant investment and running cost for power plants as well as for fuel imports. The impact of SOLTRAIN III is to contribute to a renewable energy supply system, in  particular solar thermal, thus contributing to poverty reduction. The outcome of SOLTRAIN III is to strengthen the partner institutions and the governmental bodies of the partner countries in the implementation of their sustainable national  solar thermal roll-out programs.|7.2,4.7,4.5,4.4,4.3,17.17,12.2||1|2|0||0||||1|1|||0|2|0|0|2016-03-18||||||||||||||||

Project aims: (1) demonstrate a strong urban case for a rapid-phase out of coal-fired electricity generation, and (2) utilise the research results for an effective advocacy and communications campaign at COP26. In the research project, C40 will estimate the contribution of coal combustion for C40 city electricity generation to global GHG emissions, to air quality-related health burdens in C40 cities, to COVID-19-related health impacts as well as analyse the economic benefits of different coal phase-out scenarios by looking at: (1) the economic value of improved health associated with reduced coal combustion for electricity generation in C40 cities, and (2) the number of net jobs that are generated with a switch from coal combustion to clean energy.|3.9,17,13||0||||||||||||0|1|0||2020-09-30||||||||||||||||

The project has been on the drawing board for some time. The original total loan amount was estimated to be about EUR 6.0 million (1999). The project was divided into two phases and the first phase (EUR 3.5 million) has supposedly already been implemented. ELTEL applied in January 2004 for a buyer credit guarantee for the remaining amount of EUR 2.5 million but later (2005) the size of the project was raised to about EUR 9.4 million and the concessional credit requirement to about EUR 7.2 million. The present Feasibility Study proposes a concessional credit of about EUR 6.5 million.|||0|0|0|0|0|0|||||1|1|0|0|0|0|2011-02-02||||||||||||||||

The EDISON software platform handles automated data collection, storage, access, analysis and visualization to verify the installation and use of solar systems under BGFZ's performance-based financing mechanism. Analyses based on EDISON also feed into the dialogue platform established by the Ministry of Energy in Zambia that brings together Zambian authorities, donors, development banks and energy services companies in Zambia.An expansion of the results-based financing mechanism tested in Zambia is now applied in the new contribution Beyond the Grid Fund for Africa, where the Nordic Environment Financing Corporation is the agreement partner.
